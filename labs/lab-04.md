# Lab 04 - Deploying the full Rancher UI and using Fleet CD

This lab will show you how to deploy the full Rancher UI and use it to Deploy a sample "Developer Stack" on the Rancher Desktop cluster. In the real world this could be a fast track method for getting developers quick access to full application stacks on their local machine.

## Agenda:

- Deploy the cert-manager and Rancher Helm Charts.
- Access the Rancher UI and interact with the Fleet CD UI
- Tag your local Rancher Desktop cluster and watch Fleet CD automatically deploy an application to your cluster
